# Validate with tests

The application provided includes unit tests to validate the code you are writing.  Initially these tests are not
configured to run in order to allow the project to compile.  The tests are split into multiple test bundles that
correspond with the pages of this playground that instruct you to write code (with the exception of main.swift), so as
you work through the playground you should enable tests for the work you have finished in order to validate your work.

To do this, select the "Edit Scheme" option from the "Scheme" sub-menu in the "Product" menu in Xcode.  In the dialog
that is shown, select the "Test" action on the left.  Ensure that the "Info" tab at the top is currently selected.
Click the button near the bottom left of the dialog with the "+" icon.  Select a test bundle that you wish to add and
then click the "Add" button followed by the "Close" button on the first dialog.

Once you configured the test phase of the scheme with at least one test bundle, you should be able to select the "Test"
option in the "Product" menu to run the enabled tests and validate the code they exercise.

The next page will describe how to [implement the Triathlon enum](@next).
